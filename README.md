# VBOX-Python-Based-Software-TkInter
This project aims to build an application based on Python using tkinter module built on python TkInter GUI framework. The application developed in this project is used to analyze GPS and accelerometer (usage data) sensors data in the backends and present an easy to understand dashboard to the user with dynamic functionalities on the frontend GUI. The sensor data such as latitude, longitude, speed, accelerations, course, headings etc. are filtered, cleaned and processed with complex algorithm based on signal processing and mathematical modellings techniques. Several physical parameters are computed in the backends using physical modelling for example severity matric of the usages, radius of curvature, bi-histograms of accelerations etc.

The techniques covered in the projects are:
- Data Cleaning - numpy, pandas
- Data Filtering - scipy, singal processing
- Data processing - numpy, pandas, utm
- Physical Parameters - mathematical modelling
- Data Visualization - matplotlib, folium
- GUI Design - tkinter
- Backend development - python
- Frontend development - python
- Windows Desktop Application - cx_Freeze
